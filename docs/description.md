# Game Description

## Overview

The game will follow the traditional tower defense genre with three main differentiators:

* The game's setting will be in space. Enemies move towards a planet (or large colonial ship) and the player must create defense units to protect the planet from destruction.
* Many enemies (if not dealt with early) will mutate and become more dangerous as they get closer to the target planet
* Defense units are ships and space ports that can be upgraded and modified over the course of gameplay.

## Basic UI

Players can perform the following actions:

* Track their progress through a level (how many waves left, how much life left)
* Track their currency
* Pause the game
* Tap on nodes to buy defensive units
* Tap on defensive units to upgrade or sell the unit
